Since we’ve been leaning into the **Space Pizza** theme, let’s generate the formal **Emergency Protocol Document**. This is designed to look like a high-stakes manual found in the glovebox of a galactic delivery shuttle.

* * *

## 🚨 Emergency Protocol: SOP-99

**Subject:** Interstellar Delivery Contingencies

**Authorized Personnel:** Delivery Pilots & Level 4 Baristas

**Effective Date:** January 29, 2026

* * *

### 1\. Incident Classifications

Before taking action, identify the severity of the cosmic kerfuffle:

*   **Code Blue:** Minor thermal leak; pizza crust may become slightly soggy.
    
*   **Code Orange:** Solar flare interference; GPS (Galactic Positioning System) is hallucinating.
    
*   **Code Red:** Hull breach or, worse, running out of parmesan packets.
    

* * *

### 2\. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

#### **Scenario A: Gravity Well Entrapment**

If caught in an unplanned gravitational pull, do not panic. Use the following sequence:

1.  Redirect all power from the **Toaster Oven** to the **Thrusters**.
    
2.  Perform a slingshot maneuver using the nearest moon.
    
3.  Calculate your escape velocity ($v\_e$) using:
    
    $$v\_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}$$
    
    _(Where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the planet mass, and $r$ is the radius.)_
    

#### **Scenario B: Unexpected Extraterrestrial Inspection**

If a local deity or warlord demands a "tax" of one slice:

> **Note:** Always carry a "decoy Hawaiian pizza." Most aggressive lifeforms are deterred by pineapple.

### 3\. Inventory Loss Mitigation

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Item** | **Replacement Priority** | **Alternative Use** |
| **Warp Engine** | Critical | Paperweight |
| **Thermal Pizza Bag** | High | Emergency Sleeping Bag |
| **Napkins** | Low | Universal Currency (in some sectors) |

* * *

### 4\. Communication Log (Internal)

`[12:11:10] SYSTEM: Signal Lost.`

`[12:11:12] PILOT: Does anyone know if Martians tip in Bitcoin?`

`[12:11:15] HQ: Focus on the mission, Pilot.`

### 5\. Final Checklist before "Self-Destruct"

*   \[ \] Ensure all customer data is encrypted.
    
*   \[ \] Save the secret sauce recipe to the cloud.
    
*   \[ \] Check if you left the oven on back at Base Alpha.
    
*   \[x\] Accept that "30 minutes or it's free" does not apply across dimensions.
