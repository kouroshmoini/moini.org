### 🧬 The "Flavor-Saver" Particle Filter

To ensure your pizza doesn't taste like "The Void," we use a localized atmospheric stabilizer. The pressure ($P$) inside the delivery bay is kept constant regardless of external vacuum:

$$P = \\frac{nRT}{V}$$

> **Important:** If the temperature ($T$) exceeds **200°C**, the delivery pilot is legally required to eat the inventory to prevent "waste."

* * *

### 🛰️ Integrated Software Suite

Our proprietary OS, **PEPPERONI-OS v4.1**, includes:

1.  **Auto-Pilot (Dough-Pilot):** Navigates asteroid fields while you nap.
    
2.  **Scent-Cannon:** Blasts the smell of garlic knots into a planet's atmosphere to stimulate demand.
    
3.  **Meme-Generator:** Automatically tweets your "stunning space views" to keep engagement high.

### 💬 Pilot Reviews

> "I took a wrong turn at Saturn and ended up in a nebula. The Crust-Cruiser kept the cheese perfectly melted for three weeks. 10/10 would fly again."
